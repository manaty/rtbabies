; This is the configuration file of the dressup game
; Just list in order the name of the directories that will be 
; displayed in the game, the order is linked to the order of the layers
; The name must match EXACTLY the name of the directory that contain the images
; then you follow by ":" and the hexa RGB color that will be used for this layer
; note that the Settings directory correspond to game commands and should not be removed
; nor edited : you can replace the png inside with the images you want but do not
; remove or rename those images (unless you adapt the source code).
; unless you modify the code you need a Dolls directory that contains the base
; images of the avatars.
